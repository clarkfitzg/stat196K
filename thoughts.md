Reading through my STAT 196K syllabus again.
Software development doesn't matter so much for what I'll be doing.
Neither does the particular programming language we use.
I'm fine with students using any language they prefer.

My philosophy in STAT 196K is to provide authentic experience working with large data sets.


Real data sets can easily get overwhelming.
What about having two kinds of assignments:

1. Skills- Do one, and only one, specific thing.
    Think of them like unit tests.
    For example, make sure that they can start up and SSH to an EC2 instance.
    Then check that they can use their credentials and use `aws s3` from the command line.
    I can even have one skill for every class meeting, along with an assignment that they turn in to show that they have it.
    It can just be something simple, say a screenshot or the output of some command.
    They can even do these in class.
2. Assignments- The actual data analysis, combine all the skills and use them for the actual data processing.
    Similar to assignments from STAT 128.
    All the skills are prerequisites for the assignments.
    That is, you will need all the skills to complete the assignment.

This makes me think- what's the best way to use our class time?
I want to provide regularly scheduled opportunities for interaction with peers.
How about on Discord for the last 10 minutes of every class?
I like that, because then students can stay and talk for as long as they need / wish to.
It also maintains a record of what they put in the chat, so they can go back and refer to it as needed.

Recording what we find is particularly important for this class.
They'll have to read documentation and share links to find out how to do things.

How will we have discussions / follow up for these group activities?
The first part of next class meeting, I suppose.
I can also schedule people to report, which should help them prepare and practice versus the warm call activities.

There are many skills / technologies to learn, particularly in the beginning.
There's SSH, git, S3, text editing, JSON, XML, SQL, Julia.
Then there the statistical ideas- should these be in the same category?

I could see breaking a lecture down into 3 parts:

1. Concept overview.
    Sketch on ipad, describe the idea.
2. Demo.
    Demonstrate live how to do the concept.
    Could have students follow along... but that might be too slow.
3. Practice.
    Students do it.

How long will it take to switch between ipad presentation and computer live demo?
Let me try.
8 seconds, if I'm all ready to go.
That's not a problem.

How do I publish course material?
If I publish on the web page, students and the public can easily access.
This is more valuable if the notes are relatively complete and polished.
Still, even if they start out looking rough, they'll improve as the years pass.

Do I put the whole course on the web then?
That seems like the most consistent thing to do.
Canvas assignments just have links.
Students had no trouble with that in STAT 128.

I could see writing a textbook for this course in a couple years.
It would be nice if whatever I did now set me up for that eventual goal.
My sense is that I want to write it in markdown.
