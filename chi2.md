- create and interpret QQ plots
- sample from probability distributions to test statistical methods

Important meta technique for understanding statistical methods: simulate data that exactly matches the assumptions and check that it works as expected.

Motivation: We would like to characterize a data generating process with a distribution, i.e. uniform, normal, Poisson, etc.
Why do we want to do this?

## Resources

- We already have code in Julia to do the [QQ plot](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/StatsPlots.jl#quantile-quantile-plots)

```julia
using Plots
using Distributions

# Initialize plotting
gr()
```

The QQ (quantile - quantile) plot is a useful visual tool to check if whether a particular distribution models data well.
If the QQ plot follows the line y = x reasonably well, then it means that the reference distribution is a reasonable model for the data.

Let's simulate from a uniform distribution.

```julia
U1k = Uniform(0, 1000)

x = rand(U1k, 50)
```

`quantile` gives us the quantile function.

```julia
quantile(U1k, 0.5)
```

123 GO- which quantiles should we plot for these 1000 data points?
If we plot the sorted data against these theoretical quantiles, we should see line along y = x.

```julia
GR.title("data comes from distribution - GOOD")
q1k = quantile(U1k, range(0, 1, length = length(x)))
#GR.scatter(q1k, sort(x))
plot(q1k, sort(x))
```

This is the best case scenario.

Let's try this on a distribution that we know is wrong.

```julia
function qqplot(d::UnivariateDistribution, x)
    rng = range(0, 1, length = length(x) + 2)[2:(end-1)]
    q = quantile(d, rng)
    GR.scatter(q, sort(x))
end

GR.title("data not from distribution - BAD")
qqplot(U1k, x)

normalD = Normal(mean(x), std(x))

qqplot(normalD, x)
```

How about sampling data that looks __too good__?

## Exercise

Pick two statistical distributions that look completely different.
For example, the uniform distribution looks different from the
