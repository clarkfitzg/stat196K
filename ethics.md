Discussion questions

Tomorrow we're going to discuss the ethical considerations of big data.
The discussion might be more edgy than our typical material, say on par with a movie rated PG-13.
It's fine if you need to step away.

Here are some questions for you to consider:

1. Which organizations know what information about you?
    How do they use that information?
2. What are examples of unethical uses of data?
    What safeguards do we have against the misuse and abuse of data?
3. What data should the government and law enforcement be allowed to use?

I'll kick the discussion off, but then I hope to step back and moderate while you discuss.

Got on Facebook (FB) for the first time in years.

Here are my observations.

- Got to figure out how to stop these notifications.
- FB will not let me delete fields, nor delete account.
- The tech giants certainly have more information about people than any organization ever.
- Pretty sweet that I can download all my data in JSON!
I never gave data ethics and privacy much thought until I had kids.

What kind of data is subject to ethical uses?

Who has the power?
Those who control access to the data?
Those who can analyze and query the data?

How about the government use of data?
What can a government do with data?

What if someone poses as you and does something obnoxious online?
