# One day was between 40 and 60 MB.
# So one month should be around 1500 MB, or 1.5 GB.
# To get more than 8 GB, I'll need at least 6 months.
# Download from S3 speed is around 30 MB/sec.
# Then it will take 8000/30 around 270 seconds or less than 5 minutes to stream 8 GB.
# No problem.
# I might as well do a full year then.
